# REACT Agent demo

This is a simple demo that helps us understand how a ReAct agent works. I implemented it from scratch just as a demo of how easily this type of agents can be implemented, so I omitted any optimisations and faut-tolorance mecanisms on purpose!


## How to run

Note that I use my own LLM backend to get the LLM responses and embeddings, so it is a good opportunity for self promotion here !

Try my simple (and simple to use) LLM and Encoder backend here!!
